# de_dust Game Project

de_dust is a very popular map from Counter Strike. I recreated that map in 3D from zero, i modified it to make it more modern and i ported it in my game.
* The game is based on freely walking through this map so far and i'm planning on adding extra functionality like shooting enemies and more.

## Launcher Icon picture

This is how i decided to make the icon of the game:
