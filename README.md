# de_dust Game Project

de_dust is a very popular map from Counter Strike. I recreated that map in 3D from zero, i modified it to make it more modern and i ported it in my game.
* The game is based on freely walking through this map so far and i'm planning on adding extra functionality like shooting enemies and more.


## How to install:

You can find the installer for your Android smartphone in the "APK installer" folder.
* Simply copy it in your smartphone and install it normally from there


## Launcher Icon picture

This is how i decided to make the icon of the game:
* It represents the new elements added by me to the original map and the fact that it is a picture within a picture protrays the fact that the game is meant to represent a stylised walkthrough in a popular map. It's more of a showcase.
