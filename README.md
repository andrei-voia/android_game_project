# de_dust Game Project

de_dust is a very popular map from Counter Strike. I recreated that map in 3D from zero, i modified it to make it more modern and i ported it in my game.
* The game is based on freely walking through this map so far and i'm planning on adding extra functionality like shooting enemies and more.


### How to install:

You can find the installer for your Android smartphone in the "APK installer" folder.
* Simply copy it in your smartphone and install it normally from there

## Launcher Icon picture

This is how i decided to make the icon of the game:
* It represents the new elements added by me to the original map and the fact that it is a picture within a picture protrays the fact that the game is meant to represent a stylised walkthrough in a popular map. It's more of a showcase.

## How to play

You will be able to walk through the map everywhere you want and see whatever mapzone you want.
* The way you move in the game is simple, the left half of the screen is used for movement, just touch wherever you want in that half and slide to move in that direction,
* The right half of the screen is used for orbiting (looking aroung). It works the same way as the left side, just touch and move to orbit in that direction,
* You do not have any HUD elements because i wanted to make it very minimalistic.

## In-game pictures

* Here are some screenshots taken in-game from my smartphone:
